1. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks such as the management, monitoring, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

2. Orchestration refers to the integration of multiple services that allows them to automate processes or synchronize information in a timely fashion. 

3. Say, for example, you have six or seven microservices for an application to run. If you place them in separate containers, this would inevitably create obstacles for communication. 

4. Orchestration would help in such a situation by enabling all services in individual containers to work seamlessly to accomplish a single goal. 

5. Benefits:

--->Kubernetes supports a wide variety of workloads, programming languages and frameworks, enabling stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads.

---> High availability  can be achieved using k8s.

--->Kubernetes manages various clusters at the same time.
 
--->Kubernetes self-monitors the health of nodes and containers. 

--->With Kubernetes, users can scale resources not only vertically but also horizontally that too easily and quickly.
