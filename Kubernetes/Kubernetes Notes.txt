ğŸ”° 1. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks such as the 
management, monitoring, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

ğŸ”° 2. Orchestration refers to the integration of multiple services that allows them to 
automate processes or synchronize information in a timely fashion. 

ğŸ”° 3. Say, for example, you have six or seven microservices for an application to run. 
If you place them in separate containers, this would inevitably create obstacles for communication. 

ğŸ”° 4. Orchestration would help in such a situation by enabling all services in individual containers 
to work seamlessly to accomplish a single goal. 

ğŸ”°5. Benefits:

--->Kubernetes supports a wide variety of workloads, programming languages and frameworks, 
enabling stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads.

---> High availability  can be achieved using k8s.

--->Kubernetes manages various clusters at the same time.
 
--->Kubernetes self-monitors the health of nodes and containers. 

--->With Kubernetes, users can scale resources not only vertically but also horizontally that too easily and quickly.

ğŸ”°6. A node is the smallest fundamental unit of computing hardware. It represents a single machine in a cluster, 
which could be a physical machine in a data center.The master in Kubernetes controls the nodes that have containers. 

ğŸ”°6.1 A replication controller is referred to as RC in short. It is a wrapper on a pod.
This provides additional functionality to the pods, which offers replicas. 
ğŸ”°7. Replica Set, on the other hand, is referred to as rs in short. It is told as the next-generation replication controller. 

--->This kind of support has some selector types and supports the equality-based and the set-based selectors. 

--->Replica Set is same as Replication Controller. The only difference is RS is good in management than RC

--->Equality based selector is based on an operator where it is more computer-readable. 

--->The set-based selector is an advanced concept and more human-readable, and can handle more operation easily.

--->Set based searching is the newer approach used by Replica Set. 

ğŸ”°8. RC(Replication Controller) is a resource or one of the feature in K8S to scale-in scale-out pods according to our customization and requirement. 

ğŸ”°9. If the pod terminates then RC launches same replica with same tag of all the pods. 

ğŸ”°10. It uses current and desired stated to maintain the desired state.
----> if current < desired, scale-out happen
----> if current > desired, then scale-in happen 
(incase of load) 
ğŸ”°11. Replica can be defined as Launching of Mirror image of pods in case of K8S. 

ğŸ”°12. Create and apply are the keyword to run code in K8S. In create, we cannot run edited and appended code. We can use it once.

ğŸ”°13. In apply, we can run edited and appended code. 

ğŸ”°14. Labels are the tags. 

ğŸ”°15. Labels are used by RC to launch replicas of pods with the help of template of pods.
