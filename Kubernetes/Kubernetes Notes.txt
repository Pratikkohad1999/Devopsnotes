1. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks such as the 
management, monitoring, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

2. Orchestration refers to the integration of multiple services that allows them to 
automate processes or synchronize information in a timely fashion. 

3. Say, for example, you have six or seven microservices for an application to run. 
If you place them in separate containers, this would inevitably create obstacles for communication. 

4. Orchestration would help in such a situation by enabling all services in individual containers 
to work seamlessly to accomplish a single goal. 

5. Benefits:

--->Kubernetes supports a wide variety of workloads, programming languages and frameworks, 
enabling stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads.

---> High availability  can be achieved using k8s.

--->Kubernetes manages various clusters at the same time.
 
--->Kubernetes self-monitors the health of nodes and containers. 

--->With Kubernetes, users can scale resources not only vertically but also horizontally that too easily and quickly.

6.1 A replication controller is referred to as RC in short. It is a wrapper on a pod.
This provides additional functionality to the pods, which offers replicas. 
--->Replica Set, on the other hand, is referred to as rs in short. It is told as the next-generation replication controller. 

--->This kind of support has some selector types and supports the equality-based and the set-based selectors. 

--->Replica Set is same as Replication Controller. The only difference is RS is good in management than RC

--->Equality based selector is based on an operator where it is more computer-readable. 

--->The set-based selector is an advanced concept and more human-readable, and can handle more operation easily.

--->Set based searching is the newer approach used by Replica Set.
